# Liquid Volume Converter

## A tool for bartenders

In the United States, cocktails are measured in US fluid ounces which is problematic since most spirits are delivered in bottles measured in mililiters. This simple tool allows users to convert liquid volume from US fluid ounces to mililiters or the other way around, to allow for ease in translating larger batches of cocktails, or to aid in inventory management.
